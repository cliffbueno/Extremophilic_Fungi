Environmental - Aquatic - Marine - Hydrothermal vents, n = 360
Environmental - Aquatic - Thermal springs - Hot (42-90C), n = 418
Environmental - Aquatic - Non-marine Saline and Alkaline - Hypersaline, n = 324
Environmental - Aquatic - Non-marine Saline and Alkaline - Salt crystallizer ponds, n = 27 + 12 SF Bay = 39
	12 unrestored salterns from Tringe Lab are also Salt crystallizer ponds but not classified as such, so appended manually
Environmental - Aquatic - Non-marine Saline and Alkaline - Alkaline, n = 27
Environmental - Terrestrial - Deep subsurface - Oil well, 72, all restricted, would need to contact Sean Crowe sean.crowe@ubc.ca
Environmental - Aquatic - Freshwater - Ice, n = 79 (10 Tibet restricted)
Environmental - Terrestrial - Soil - Glacier, n = 68
Environmental - Terrestrial - Soil - Desert, n = 94 (many restricted)
Environmental - Terrestrial - Soil: Filter to Elevation > 3500 m, n = 0. Lots of unreported. Highest reported elevation is 988 m.

-Filter Sequence center != DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and Is Public = Yes
-Filter Sequence center = DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and JGI Data Utilization Status = Unrestricted
-Filter out duplicates
-Filter out duplicates that were reassembled with SPAdes and contain (SPAdes) at the end of the Genome Name/ Sample Name
-Make comma separated list of taxonoids to search for in Genome Search

Search for taxonoids save as 1 table

Split into two tables
